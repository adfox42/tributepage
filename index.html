            Best selling novel: Cat's Cradle<br>
            My favorite quote: “Here we are, trapped in the amber of the moment. There is no why.” — Kurt Vonnegut.<br>
            <br>Kurt Vonnegut was the first author whose work I absolutely fell in love with. I remember going to my local bookstore and purchasing Slaughterhouse-Five.
            <br>I finished the novel in a day. From there I went on to purchase more of his novels and quickly became obsessed with his work. My favorite novel that he
            <br> wrote was "Mother Night".
